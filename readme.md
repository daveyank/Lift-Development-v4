# Lift Development Theme v4

This is the 2017 iteration of the custom WordPress theme used for LiftDevelopment.com. It is a child theme for the Genesis Framework: http://studiopress.com/genesis

Originally based on the Genesis Sample theme but completely customized.

The site/theme heavily relies on functionality in Advanced Custom Fields Pro: https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/


## Notes

All of the primary CSS is generated from style.scss in the theme's root folder. I am including the .css and .map files generated by CodeKit. The theme itself utilizes the .css file and browsers use the .map file to provide line numbers of the .scss file in the inspector.
